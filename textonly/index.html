Hello, there this is a test for my text only web browser thing, so like ingore everything I say on this webpage
This webpage is only meant to be viewed in like a console or something, and not intended for a webbrowser, like google chrome or literally any sane person browser. BUT, im sure you can still see it
Oh my goodness do NOT try to type normal text using notepad++, actually say, I'm curious
