<p align="left">I just got a new CRT tv (well not neccessarily new, but I got it down from my parents attic) I am very excited to do some cool things with it. I've already connected a Xbox 360, Wii U and SNES to it, and I've recorded some cool things to VHS tape, all I am missing is the TV remote so I can configure the settings (for example setting it to LP VHS mode, instead of SP) and degaussing the thing because theres spots on the TV that are all messed up in colour, but other than that, its a great CRT.</p>

<p align="left">I'm actually gonna start doing something with this page lmao. Anyways I've been recently building really shittily in this minecraft 1.1 world I have, and it's been really fun turning my brain off and building on the same level as 6 to 7 year old me. I've been worrying too much about things &quot;looking good&quot; and perfecting things, but in reaity. I think it's better for me to not worry about any of that</p>
